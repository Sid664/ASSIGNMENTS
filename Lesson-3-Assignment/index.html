        <p> <b> Starfish</b> or <b>sea stars</b> are
    <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_polygon">star-shaped</a>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinoderm">echinoderms</a></i>
    belonging to the <i>class</i> <b>Asteroidea</b>. Common usage frequently
    finds these names being also applied to
    <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittle_star">ophiuroids</a></i>, which are correctly referred to as
    <i>brittle stars</i> or basket stars.</p>

    <p>Starfish are also known as <b>asteroids</b> due to being in the class
    Asteroidea. About 1,900 species of starfish occur on the
    <i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed">seabed</a></i> in all the
    world's <i>oceans</i>, from warm, <i>tropical zones</i> to frigid,
    <i>polar regions</i>. They are found from the <i>intertidal zone</i> down to
    <i>abyssal</i> depths, at 6,000 <abbr title="meter">m</abbr> (20,000
    <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) below the surface. Starfish are
    <i>marine invertebrates</i>. They typically have a central disc and usually
    five arms, though some species have a larger number of arms. The aboral or
    upper surface may be smooth, granular or spiny, and is covered with
    overlapping plates.</p>


    <p><em style="color: red">
        Many species are brightly coloured in various shades of red or orange,
        while others are blue, grey or brown.</em>
    Starfish have
    <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_feet">tube feet</a></i>
    operated by a <i>hydraulic system</i> and a mouth at the centre of the oral
    or lower surface. They are <i>opportunistic</i> feeders and are mostly
    <i>predators</i> on <i>benthic</i> invertebrates. Several species have
    specialized feeding behaviours including eversion of their stomachs and
    <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_feeding">suspension feeding</a></i>. They have complex
    <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle">life cycles</a></i>
    and can reproduce both sexually and <i>asexually</i>. Most can
    <i>regenerate</i> damaged parts or lost arms and they can shed arms as a
    means of defense. The Asteroidea occupy several significant
    <i>ecological roles</i>. Starfish, such as the
    <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochre_sea_star">ochre sea star</a></i>
    <b>(Pisaster ochraceus)</b> and the
    <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stichaster_australis">reef sea star</a></i>
    <b>(Stichaster australis)</b>, have become widely known as examples of the
    <i> keystone species</i> concept in ecology. The tropical
    <i> crown-of-thorns starfish</i> <b>(Acanthaster planci)</b> is a voracious
    predator of coral throughout the Indo-Pacific region, and the
    <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterias_amurensis">northern Pacific sea star</a></i>
    is considered to be one of the <i> world's 100 worst invasive species</i>.</p>
    <p>The <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil">fossil</a></i> record
    for starfish is ancient, dating back to the <i>Ordovician</i> around 450
    million years ago, but it is rather sparse, as starfish tend to disintegrate
    after death. Only the
    <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossicle_(echinoderm)">ossicles</a></i>
    and spines of the animal are likely to be preserved, making remains hard to
    locate. With their appealing symmetrical shape, starfish have played a part
    in literature, legend, design and popular culture. They are sometimes
    collected as curios, used in design or as logos, and in some cultures,
    <strong>despite possible toxicity, they are eaten.</strong></p>
