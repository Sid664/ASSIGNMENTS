                Starfish are predators, and they’re probably the most important
                predator in the shallow ecosystem – so the depths where we would dive
                or swim. They eat basically anything that they can come across. Their
                feeding activities control the whole ecosystem.

                Echinoderms, including starfish, maintain a delicate internal
                electrolyte balance that is in equilibrium with sea water, making it
                impossible for them to live in a freshwater habitat. Starfish species
                inhabit all of the world's oceans. Habitats range from tropical coral
                reefs, rocky shores, tidal pools, mud, and sand to kelp forests,
                seagrass meadows and the deep-sea floor down to at least 6,000
                <abbr title="meter">m</abbr> (20,000 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>).
                The greatest diversity of species occurs in coastal areas.

                Most species are generalist predators, eating microalgae, sponges,
                bivalves, snails and other small animals. The crown-of-thorns starfish
                consumes coral polyps, while other species are detritivores, feeding
                on decomposing organic material and faecal matter. A few are
                suspension feeders, gathering in phytoplankton; Henricia and
                Echinaster often occur in association with sponges, benefiting from
                the water current they produce. Various species have been shown to be
                able to absorb organic nutrients from the surrounding water, and this
                may form a significant portion of their diet. The processes of feeding
                and capture may be aided by special parts; Pisaster brevispinus, the
                short-spined pisaster from the West Coast of America, can use a set of
                specialized tube feet to dig itself deep into the soft substrate to
                extract prey (usually clams). Grasping the shellfish, the starfish
                slowly pries open the prey's shell by wearing out its adductor muscle,
                and then inserts its everted stomach into the crack to digest the soft
                tissues. The gap between the valves need only be a fraction of a
                millimetre wide for the stomach to gain entry.Cannibalism has been
                observed in juvenile sea stars as early as four days after
                metamorphosis

                Starfish are keystone species in their respective marine communities.
                Their relatively large sizes, diverse diets and ability to adapt to
                different environments makes them ecologically important. The term
                "keystone species" was in fact first used by Robert Paine in 1966 to
                describe a starfish, Pisaster ochraceus. When studying the low
                intertidal coasts of Washington state, Paine found that predation by
                P. ochraceus was a major factor in the diversity of species.
                Experimental removals of this top predator from a stretch of shoreline
                resulted in lower species diversity and the eventual domination of
                Mytilus mussels, which were able to outcompete other organisms for
                space and resources. Similar results were found in a 1971 study of
                Stichaster australis on the intertidal coast of the South Island of
                New Zealand. S. australis was found to have removed most of a batch of
                transplanted mussels within two or three months of their placement,
                while in an area from which S. australis had been removed, the mussels
                increased in number dramatically, overwhelming the area and
                threatening biodiversity.

                Starfish may be preyed on by conspecifics, sea anemones, other
                starfish species, tritons, crabs, fish, gulls and sea otters. Their
                first lines of defence are the saponins present in their body walls,
                which have unpleasant flavours. Some starfish such as Astropecten
                polyacanthus also include powerful toxins such as tetrodotoxin among
                their chemical armoury, and the slime star can ooze out large
                quantities of repellent mucus. They also have body armour in the form
                of hard plates and spines. The crown-of-thorns starfish is
                particularly unattractive to potential predators, being heavily
                defended by sharp spines, laced with toxins and sometimes with bright
                warning colours. Other species protect their vulnerable tube feet and
                arm tips by lining their ambulacral grooves with spines and heavily
                plating their extremities.

            <p>
                Several species sometimes suffer from a wasting condition caused by
                bacteria in the genus Vibrio; however, a more widespread wasting
                disease, causing mass mortalities among starfish, appears
                sporadically. A paper published in November 2014 revealed the most
                likely cause of this disease to be a densovirus the authors named sea
                star-associated densovirus (SSaDV). The protozoan Orchitophrya
                stellarum is known to infect the gonads of starfish and damage tissue.
                Starfish are vulnerable to high temperatures. Experiments have shown
                that the feeding and growth rates of P. ochraceus reduce greatly when
                their body temperatures rise above 23
                <abbr title="Celsius">°C</abbr> (73
                <abbr title=" Fahrenheit">°F</abbr> ) and that they die when their
                temperature rises to 30 <abbr title="Celsius">°C</abbr> (86
                <abbr title=" Fahrenheit">°F</abbr> ). This species has a unique
                ability to absorb seawater to keep itself cool when it is exposed to
                sunlight by a receding tide. It also appears to rely on its arms to
                absorb heat, so as to protect the central disc and vital organs like
                the stomach.

                Starfish and other echinoderms are sensitive to marine pollution. The
                common starfish is considered to be a bioindicator for marine
                ecosystems. A 2009 study found that P. ochraceus is unlikely to be
                affected by ocean acidification as severely as other marine animals
                with calcareous skeletons. In other groups, structures made of calcium
                carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution when the pH is lowered.
                Researchers found that when P. ochraceus were exposed to 21
                <abbr title="Celsius">°C</abbr> (70
                <abbr title=" Fahrenheit">°F</abbr> ) and 770
                <abbr title="parts-per notation">ppm</abbr> carbon dioxide (beyond
                rises expected in the next century), they were relatively unaffected.
                Their survival is likely due to the nodular nature of their skeletons,
                which are able to compensate for a shortage of carbonate by growing
                more fleshy tissue.
